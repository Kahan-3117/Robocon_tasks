in the task1 A: i created sketches and extruded the sketches. i tried to make as dimensionally accurate as possible by counting the grid dots
in task1 B: i created sketches and extruded the sketches. i tried to make as dimensionally accurate as possible by counting thr grid dots.
in task 2 : first i tried to make the model by using intersection curve. i created top view and side view and use intersection curve to project a 3d sketch of the model. but i was unable to make the complete model.
then i tried using loft tool. i made top view and bottom vieew and connected them through cross section sketches. after that i used loft tool through the cross sections to complete the model. but the results did not satisfy me.
finally i used another method. here i created side view and cross section sketches aand used 3d sketch tool to connect the the cross section and side view to make a complete 3d sketch.then i used surface patch tool to create all the surfaces. then i added a pair of strakes using loft tool where i made small triangular cross sections at the bottom and coonected them using loft tool. finally i mirored the body. finally i got the model
